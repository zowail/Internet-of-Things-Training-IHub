IClub Internet of Things 2016 Training - at Faculty of Engineering Ain Shams University

Worked with a team of eight members on creating 3 projects for the 3 phases of the competition

First Project:
A small car that is controlled by Arduino Uno microcontroller and an android mobile app.

Tools:
Hardware: Arduino Uno, dc motors, motor drivers, PCB, batteries
Software: Arduino IDE, Eagle for PCB design, App inventor for the android app

Second Project:

Worked with my team to add new features to our car and make it autonomous by using some sensors help the car avoid any obstacles

Tools:
Hardware: Ultrasonic sensor, Piezo electric sensor, Buzzer.

Third Project:

Health Care Gear: A simple watch that we created to facilitate taking care of the elderly
